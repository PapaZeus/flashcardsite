        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <div class ="question">Question</div>
        <div class ="answer">In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.</div>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <div class ="question">Question</div>
        <div class ="answer">A method in object-oriented programming is a procedure associated with a class. A method defines the behavior of the objects that are created from the class. Another way to say this is that a method is an action that an object is able to perform.</div>

        <div class ="question">Question</div>
        <div class ="answer"> Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.</div>
